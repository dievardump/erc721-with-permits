# EIP4494 or ERC721 Permit

This repository contains an implementation of the [proposed EIP 4494](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4494), introducing permits for ERC721 contracts 

This allows off-chain signing of permits allowing contracts or other actors to get approved & transfer in one transaction
